This folder stores the trained model checkpoints for each of the three core tasks in the project. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific task, and contains the model weights, optimizer state, and optionally training metadata (metrics, configs, etc.).

These checkpoints allow for:

- Model recovery (resume training)

- Inference and evaluation

- Experiment tracking and comparison
